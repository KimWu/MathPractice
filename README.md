用試算表練習基本的四則運算，讓小學生練習加減乘除快速運算方法。讓學生只要用草稿紙記下少量輔助數字就可以又快又准地心算， 擺脫傳統又慢又容易出錯的豎式計算方法。

Use a spreadsheet to practice the basic four arithmetic operations, and let elementary school students practice the quick operation methods of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Let the students do mental arithmetic quickly and accurately by writing down a small number of auxiliary numbers on scratch paper, and get rid of the traditional vertical calculation method that is slow and error-prone.
